Instead of focusing on procedures or functions, OOP organizes software design by grouping related data and behavior into objects. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (allowing new objects to inherit properties from existing ones), and polymorphism (allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way), all aimed at creating more modular, reusable, and maintainable code."

Its primary significance lies in providing a way for a subclass to call methods from its superclass in a way that is robust and maintains the integrity of multiple inheritance scenarios. When you override a method in a subclass, super() allows you to invoke the original implementation of that method from the superclass, often to extend its functionality rather than completely replace it. This promotes code reuse and avoids redundancy. Furthermore, in complex inheritance structures, particularly with multiple inheritance, super() ensures that methods in the inheritance hierarchy are called in the correct order according to the method resolution order (MRO), preventing issues that can arise from directly calling the superclass method by name. This makes your code more maintainable and less prone to errors when dealing with intricate class relationships."

Its significance lies in providing a last opportunity for the object to perform any necessary cleanup operations before it's destroyed. This might include releasing external resources like open files, network connections, or database cursors that the object was holding. However, it's important to note that the __del__ method is not guaranteed to be called immediately when an object becomes unreferenced, and in some cases (like circular references), it might not be called at all. Due to this unpredictability and potential complexities, it's generally recommended to rely on more explicit mechanisms for resource management, such as try...finally blocks or context managers (with statement), rather than depending heavily on __del__ for critical cleanup tasks."
